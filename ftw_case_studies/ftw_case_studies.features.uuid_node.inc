<h3 dir="ltr">The Issue</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The reporter was using assistive technology; instead of a mouse, she was working with The Grid 2 in conjunction with Smartnav, which is operated by a laptop-mounted camera, following the movement of a silver dot worn on her forehead.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The various boxes to fill in and menus to navigate on the CBS Website, required absolute placement of the pointer, but this was proving impossible.  This was when The Reporter turned to Fix the Web.  The reporter had encountered the same problems when logging on to the NatWest Website, useful information for the Volunteer to have.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<h3 dir="ltr">The Process</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The Volunteer’s role involved communicating with a number of parties, initially between CBS and the Reporter, and in the process discovered that the problem lay with Rapport software on the CBS site. A detailed (email) conversation began between Rapport Technical Support, the Volunteer and the Reporter.  Rapport was keen to identify the problem, took responsibility, acted fast and offered compensation to the Reporter – in the form of a £30 Amazon gift voucher.  The Volunteer took a pivotal role – liaising initially between CBS, Rapport and The Reporter.  He not only passed information and requests on to the relevant parties, he also clarified points and identified possible options and solutions.  As a result, the reporter was left with a way to navigate their CBS account but to do so, would have to uninstall Rapport, and pay the price of less security to go onto the CBS Website.  She was not prepared to do this. But through the Fix the Web process, her needs were heard and respected.

<h3 dir="ltr">The Fix</h3>
